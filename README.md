# Face Recognition-Based Attendance System Using ESP32-CAM

Welcome to the Face Recognition-Based Attendance System project, where we leverage the power of ESP32-CAM and Arduino Nano to create an innovative attendance management solution. 

**Project Overview:**

This project combines the versatility of the ESP32-CAM module and the processing capabilities of Arduino Nano to develop an intelligent attendance system. By utilizing facial recognition technology, it simplifies the attendance tracking process, making it efficient and secure.

**Key Features:**

- Utilizes ESP32-CAM and Arduino Nano for seamless integration and robust performance.
- Streamlines attendance management with facial recognition, eliminating the need for traditional methods.
- Offers real-time attendance tracking and reporting, enhancing data accuracy and accessibility.
- Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for administrators and users.
- Promotes security and accountability by accurately identifying and recording attendance.
- Customizable and adaptable to various settings, from classrooms to workplaces.
- Supports the growth of a paperless and eco-friendly attendance management system.

In this project you can connect any webcam by changing the index number of the camera of the https protocol to request the video feed from the webcam 
Here, we utilised ESP 32 CAM as a webcam where both the system and CAM should be connedcted to the same WIFI to host the server and to execute the project.
